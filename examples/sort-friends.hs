{- This example shows how to extract all
 - user friends, get their similarity score and
 - then sort them based on it outputting top 5
 -
 - User friends of which are searched is 'target'
 -
 - Most of hard work there is on 'aeson-lens' actually :)
 -
 - Sample output:
 -
 - % ./examples/sort-friends.hs
 - Artvart: 0.9969767332077
 - smpcln: 0.9965825676918
 - nv0id: 0.86804795265198
 - QueenrXy: 0.5932799577713
 - GhostOsaka: 0.2875879406929
 -
 - Notice: you may want to adjust maximum open files limit
 - if testing on users with relatively large friends count
